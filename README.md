# TinyMCE Visual merge tags plugin

- Locked version of TinyMCE is included
- the custom plugin is located in `custom-plugin/visual-merge-tags.js`

## Development

Spin up a local server to host the assets (works great with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)) and open `index.html`
 

## Todo

- Make a custom pop up example is located in `todo-assets/pop-up-showcase.png`. It doesn't have to pixel perfect.
- Would it be possible to make text larger or smaller based on the font size of text around it, but keep it in a certain range. Let's say minimal font size would be 12px and maximum 24px.
